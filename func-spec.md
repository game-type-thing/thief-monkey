# Asking for Help

When a player asks for help or a hint, Alexa will offer some suggestions of questions that they haven't asked yet. If all questions have been asked, then Alexa says that she's already told the player everything that she knows.

# Answers

Some objects come in different varieties that can result in different answers to some of the questions. But when Thief Monkey steals an object, it's always a specific one with specific answers. For example, if Thief Monkey steals an apple, then the color will either be "green" or "red"; it won't be "green or red".

# Objects

Objects must be easily recognizable by children.

# Future Ideas

- Add two-player mode in which players take turns asking questions and guessing.
